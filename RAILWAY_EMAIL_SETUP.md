# üìß Email Setup Guide for Railway.com

## üö® **Current Issue**
Your email notifications are not working on Railway.com because of missing environment variables and Gmail security settings.

## üîß **Step-by-Step Fix**

### **Step 1: Setup Gmail App Password**

1. **Go to Google Account Settings:**
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/
   - Click "Security" in the left sidebar

2. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication:**
   - Under "Signing in to Google", click "2-Step Verification"
   - Follow the setup process if not already enabled

3. **Generate App Password:**
   - Go back to Security settings
   - Click "App passwords" (under 2-Step Verification)
   - Select "Mail" as the app
   - Select "Other" as the device and enter "Railway PipsMade"
   - **Copy the 16-character password** (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### **Step 2: Set Railway Environment Variables**

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Select your PipsMade project

2. **Add Environment Variables:**
   - Click on your service/project
   - Go to "Variables" tab
   - Add these variables:

```bash
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin@email.com
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_NAME=production
```

**Example:**
```bash
EMAIL_HOST_USER=Celewizzy106@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
ADMIN_EMAIL=Celewizzy106@gmail.com
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=support@pipsmade.com
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_NAME=production
```

### **Step 3: Deploy and Test**

1. **Redeploy your application:**
   - Railway will automatically redeploy when you add environment variables
   - Or manually trigger a deployment

2. **Test email functionality:**
   ```bash
   # SSH into Railway or use Railway CLI
   railway run python manage.py test_email --email your-email@gmail.com
   ```

3. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```

## üß™ **Testing Commands**

### **Test Email Configuration:**
```bash
python manage.py test_email --config
```

### **Test Email Connection:**
```bash
python manage.py test_email --test-connection
```

### **Send Test Email:**
```bash
python manage.py test_email --email your-email@gmail.com
```

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

#### **1. "Authentication failed" Error**
- **Cause:** Wrong app password or 2FA not enabled
- **Fix:** 
  - Regenerate Gmail app password
  - Ensure 2FA is enabled
  - Use app password, not regular password

#### **2. "Connection timed out" Error**
- **Cause:** Railway blocking SMTP connections
- **Fix:** 
  - Try alternative email services (SendGrid, Mailgun)
  - Check Railway firewall settings

#### **3. "Environment variables not found" Error**
- **Cause:** Variables not set in Railway
- **Fix:** 
  - Double-check variable names (case-sensitive)
  - Ensure variables are set in correct service
  - Redeploy after adding variables

#### **4. "Email sent but not received" Error**
- **Cause:** Gmail spam filters or rate limiting
- **Fix:** 
  - Check spam folder
  - Verify recipient email address
  - Try different recipient

### **Alternative Email Services (Recommended for Production):**

#### **SendGrid (Recommended):**
```bash
# Railway Environment Variables
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=apikey
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-sendgrid-api-key
```

#### **Mailgun:**
```bash
# Railway Environment Variables
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mailgun.org
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-mailgun-username
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-mailgun-password
```
